1. What Is the Difference Between Beanfactory and Applicationcontext?

- BeanFactory is an interface representing a container that provides and manages bean instances. The default implementation instantiates beans lazily when getBean() is called.
- ApplicationContext is an interface representing a container holding all information, metadata, and beans in the application. It also extends the BeanFactory interface but the default implementation instantiates beans eagerly when the application starts. This is highly recommended to use.

2. How to Define the Scope of a Bean?

- There are 6 types of default Bean scope. In terms of thread scope, it is generated after Spring 3.0.

3. What Does the Spring Bean Lifecycle Look Like?

- First of all, Spring Bean should be generated by Java or xml bean definition. When bean is no longer used, it can be removed from IoC container.

4. Are Singleton Beans Thread-Safe?

- No. It's not Thread-safe. It's because when there is a mutable variable in Spring bean such as VO or DTO, it can be changed since it is located in Heap memory location(All threads are sharing Heap memory location). Only the variables which are located in Stack memory region can be unchangeable.
